## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Fuzzy Rough Set (FRS) Loss, a novel loss function designed for precise medical image segmentation tasks. The FRS Loss leverages fuzzy rough set theory to better handle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in medical image segmentation, particularly in boundary regions and areas with ambiguous annotations.

## Key Features
- **Boundary-Aware Learning**: Enhanced focus on boundary regions for more precise segmentation
- **Robust to Noise**: Handles uncertainty and ambiguity in medical imaging data
- **Model-Agnostic**: Can be easily integrated with various deep learning architectures
- **Theoretically Grounded**: Based on fuzzy rough set theory for principled uncertainty handling

## Getting Started
*The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.*

## Results
